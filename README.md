# Final-Version-Working

In the making of this game I defined 16 image boxes that will display the original image split into sixteen pieces.
The player will be able to move the empty image around until all the pieces will be in the right position and the winning screen will pop up.
The original image will also be displayed so that the player can have a clue about the image that he has to reconstruct.
